# Nonlinear-Optimization-on-fed-batch-reactor-system
This survey relates to using nonlinear optimization to improve or optimize fed-batch reactor system regarding the discussion in the academic journal presented “Optimization of fed-batch bioreactors using genetic algorithm: multiple control variables” by Debasis Sarkar and Jayant M. Modak, published in Computers &amp; Chemical Engineering. Furthermore, the original article, “Optimal Production of Secreted Protein in Fed-Batch Reactors” by Seujeung Park and W. Fred Ramirez, published in AIChE Journal, Volume 34. Additionally, it should be acknowledged this report was produced for ISE 3210 (Nonlinear and Dynamic Optimization) at Ohio State University and is not meant for reproduction or publication.
